Write a program which allows the user to get information about a predefined set of animals.

Three animals are predefined, cow, bird, and snake.

Each animal can eat, move, and speak.

Your program should present the user with a prompt, “>”, to indicate that the user can type a request.

Your program accepts one request at a time from the user, prints out the answer to the request,
and prints out a new prompt.

Your program should continue in this loop forever.

Every request from the user must be a single line containing 2 strings.

The first string is the name of an animal, either “cow”, “bird”, or “snake”.
The second string is the name of the information requested about the animal, either “eat”, “move”, or “speak”.

Your program should process each request by printing out the requested data.
